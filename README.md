This research explores how machine learning can con-
tribute to the early detection of breast cancer and ultimately im-
prove treatment outcomes. The study adopts a thorough approach,
encompassing various stages such as data preparation, model creation,
parameter optimization, and rigorous evaluation, to develop a depend-
able breast cancer detection model. First, the dataset containing breast
cancer information is visualized, and the data is divided into separate
training and testing sets. To ensure fair comparisons, the features
are standardized, making them compatible for different machine
learning models. Several popular algorithms, including Support Vector
Classifier, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes,
Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, are employed
to build multiple models. To fine-tune the model and enhance its
performance, the XGBoost Classifier undergoes a series of experiments
with randomized parameter settings. The models are then evaluated
using various techniques, such as confusion matrix, classification
report, ROC curve, AUC, precision-recall curve, cross-validation, and
accuracy measurements. These evaluation methods provide insights
into the modelsâ€™ performance, classification accuracy, and their ability
to generalize to new data. The results show that an accurate breast
cancer detection model can significantly influence patient outcomes
by enabling early detection. This study highlights the importance
of harnessing the power of information and technology to advance
the field of medicine, especially breast cancer detection. Integrating
machine learning technology into medical practice will help medical
professionals improve their diagnostic skills and provide better care
for people living with breast cancer.
